<h3><a name="sec-2">1.1 What Is AxsJAX-Enhanced Jawbreaker?</a></h3>



<p>
AxsJAX-Enhanced Jawbreaker is <a href="http://www.minijuegosgratis.com/juegos/jawbreaker/jawbreaker.htm">a regular Jawbreaker game</a> that was AxsJAXed. Jawbreaker is a puzzle game that challenges the player to get as high a score as possible by eliminating as many balls of the same color in one shot as possible. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawbreaker_(Pocket_PC_game)">For a detailed explanation on the history and rules of this game, please see the Wikipedia article on Jawbreaker.</a>
</p>


<h3><a name="sec-3">1.2 How Can I Start Using AxsJAX-Enhanced Jawbreaker?</a></h3>


<p>
The simplest way to get started is to use <a href="http://firevox.clcworld.net/">Fire Vox</a> and check the
"Site Specific Enhancements" option. By default, this option is
checked, so if you did not change it, then you should be ready to
go. To start using AxsJAX-Enhanced Jawbreaker, all you
need to do is go to <a href="http://www.minijuegosgratis.com/juegos/jawbreaker/jawbreaker.htm">the Jawbreaker game page</a> - the AxsJAX enhancements will
automatically be added for you. There is nothing Fire Vox
specific about AxsJAX - to use a different setup, all you need to
do is make sure that you have the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
A modern Web browser like Firefox 2.0 or later that supports
W3C ARIA.
</li>
<li>
An adaptive technology that will respond correctly to the
accessibility enhancements introduced by W3C ARIA.
In particular, many of the enhancements injected by AxsJAX
depend on support for <i>live regions</i> a feature that enables
adaptive technologies like screen readers and self-voicing
browsers deal correctly with asynchronous updates to
portions of a Web page.

</li>
</ol>
If your setup meets these requirements, you can either install
<a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748">GreaseMonkey</a> and install the <a href="http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/googleScriptLoader.user.js">GreaseMonkey script for AxsJAX enhancements</a> or you can install <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/Login?continue=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-axsjax%2Fdownloads%2Flist">the bookmarklet for AxsJAX enhancements.</a> Keep in mind that if you use the bookmarklet
approach, you will have to activate the bookmarklet when you
visit the Jawbreaker page in order to activate the AxsJAX
enhancements.


<h3><a name="sec-4">1.3 How Do I Use These Features?</a></h3>


<p>
The AxsJAX enhancements provide keyboard navigation for the game. If your
assistive technology uses different modes e.g., <i>browse-mode</i> in
JFW, please switch to the mode that you use for working with
forms and web applications so that your keystrokes will be sent
to the web page itself. When you are on the Jawbreaker page,
the following keys are available:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
 ? (question mark): Brings up a list of keyboard commands.
</li>
<li>
 n: Starts a new game.
</li>
<li>
 Arrow keys OR h,j,k,l: Navigate the board one ball at a time. The ball's color and coordinates will be announced.
</li>
<li>
 a,e,t,b: Jump to the edges of the board.
</li>
<li>
 Capital R,G,B,Y,P: Jump to the next ball of a specific color.
</li>
<li>
 r: Reads the current row that you are on.
</li>
<li>
 c: Reads the current column that you are on.
</li>
<li>
 s: Reads the current stats (balls selected, points that would be earned for making the currently selected balls disappear, total score).
</li>
<li>
 = (equals): Reads the current number of balls remaining for each color.
</li>
<li>
 Space: If the current ball is not selected, pressing space will select the group of balls that the current ball belongs to if it is part of a group. If the current ball is selected, pressing space confirms the selection and makes the selected group disappear.
</li>
<li>
 d: Deselects the currently selected balls.
</li>
<li>
 u: Undoes the last confirmed selection.
