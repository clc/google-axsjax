= Get your own Google-AxsJAX Shirt =

We are giving away Google-AxsJAX shirts to anyone who writes good AxsJAX scripts. Please post your scripts on [http://groups.google.com/group/accessible the Google Accessible grouplist]; if the script is good, we'll include it in the project, give you full credit for it, and send a Google-AxsJAX t-shirt your way!

These shirts have [http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/logos/braille.gif the Google logo in Braille] on the front and [http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/logos/AXSJAX.png the AxsJAX logo] on the back. Offer good while supplies last, so write your script today!
