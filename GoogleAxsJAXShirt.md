# Get your own Google-AxsJAX Shirt #

We are giving away Google-AxsJAX shirts to anyone who writes good AxsJAX scripts.

Please post your scripts on [the Google Accessible grouplist](http://groups.google.com/group/accessible).

If the script is good, we'll include it in the project, give you full credit for it, and send a Google-AxsJAX t-shirt your way!

These shirts have [the Google logo in Braille](http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/logos/braille.gif) on the front and [the AxsJAX logo](http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/logos/AXSJAX.png) on the back.

Offer good while supplies last, so write your script today!
