* Setting Up Your Development Environment

While there are many ways to set up your development environment for working 
with AxsJAX, this tutorial will cover the easiest way to setup and get going. 
You may substitute any of the tools here for ones that you are more comfortable 
with that have the same functionality, but this guide will assume that you are 
using the tools listed here.

  1. [[http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable][Get Portable Firefox.]] This will give you a sandboxed version of Firefox with a clean profile so that you don't need to worry about conflicts with any existing extensions. 
  2. Install the following extensions on your Portable Firefox:
    - [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748][Greasemonkey]]  for injecting scripts.
    - [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1192][XPather]]  for interactively discovering XPath locators.
    - [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1100][Event Spy]]  for inspecting events as they happen.
    - [[http://www.firevox.clcworld.net/installation.html][Fire Vox]]  for adding spoken output to Firefox.
  3. Download the [[http://www.server2go-web.de/download/download.html]["MICRO-PACKAGE" of Server2Go]] and unzip it to your hard drive.
  4. Save the [[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/skel/axsSkel.js][axsSkel.js]] file under the "htdocs" directory of where you unzipped Server2Go in the previous step.
  5. Start Server2Go. You will get a browser window with a URL that looks like "http://127.0.0.1:4001/" and a page that says you are running Server2Go successfully. Make a note of what your URL is.
  6. Install [[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/skel/axsSkelLoader.user.js][axsSkelLoader.user.js]] as a Greasemonkey script. By default this will run on all pages; you may want to change this to only run on the page that you will be working on by going to Tools > Greasemonkey > Manage User Scripts and editing the "Included Pages" setting to just be your target page.
  7. Go to Tools > Greasemonkey > Manage User Scripts and select "axsSkelLoader". Click "Edit". Look at the line that reads:
    : /* Modify this line to match where you have the script that you are working on */
    : myScript.src = 'http://127.0.0.1:4001/axsSkel.js';
    and verify that this URL is indeed what your URL was in step 5. If not, change it to match and save the file.
  8. Go to the site you wish to apply AxsJAX to. You should get an alert box saying: "AxsSkel loaded and initialized!"
  
  

* Applying AxsJAX to Content Rich Sites

1. Write a [[cnr.html][Content Navigation Rule (CNR)]] for the site. 
An easy way to generate the xpaths is to use the DOM Inspector in Firefox 
with XPather. That will give you a raw xpath that you can then simplify and 
generalize.

2. Replace this line:
:var cnrString = "PUT THE CNR XML HERE";
in your axsSkel.js file with the CNR that you wrote in the previous step.

3. Try it out! At this point, the navigation should be working and you should 
be able to easily get to all the content on the page. If there is important 
content that you cannot reach, make sure that you are really including it in 
your xpath expressions. As in step 1, XPather and DOM Inspector are 
indispensable.
	   
4. If there is more functionality that needs to be enabled, you can augment 
the axsSkel.js file with your own functions that are tailored for the site. 

* Example: Enhancing Google Product Search Via AxsJAX

** Writing the CNR file

The main trail here is the list of items returned by Product Search. Let's 
try to find the xpath for those items. Use DOM Inspector and click on the 
first result. That will select a node in the DOM tree. If that selection is 
too narrow, move up the tree until you select more. When you are satisfied 
with what the flashing rectangle has selected, note the XPath expression that 
you get.

[[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/tutorial/images/xpath_00.png]]

Now use DOM Inspector and click on the second result. Notice that the second 
result's xpath is quite similar to the first result's.

[[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/tutorial/images/xpath_01.png]]

The first xpath is:
: /html/body/table[3]/tbody/tr[2]
and the second is:
: /html/body/table[3]/tbody/tr[3]

Based on that, a good guess for the xpath for all the results would be:
: /html/body/table[3]/tbody/tr[*]
Let's put that into XPather and see what we get.

[[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/tutorial/images/xpath_02.png]]

This is pretty close to what we want, but we are getting an extra node at the 
front. Notice that this extra node has a class name.
To exclude it, let's change the xpath to only include nodes without class"
: /html/body/table[3]/tbody/tr[not(@class)]

[[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/tutorial/images/xpath_03.png]]

Success! Now we only have the search results. 

At this point, all we have to do is decide on the navigation keys we want to use and then 
write the CNR.

[[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/tutorial/productSearch_cnr_00.xml][Here's the CNR file that we got.]]

** Putting the CNR file into the JS file.
This step is pretty easy. Open up your axsSkel.js file and put in the CNR 
string.

[[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/tutorial/axsProductSearch_00.js][This is the JS file that we got.]]

** Load up http://www.google.com/products and do a search.
Ok, not bad for a first attempt. It mostly works, but there are definitely 
some areas for improvement. For starters, the user isn't taken to the next 
page when they reach the end of a page of results and try to go forward. 
Similarly, they should be taken to the previous page if they reach the first 
result and try to go backward. Let's add targets with "listTail"/"listHead" 
triggers to address this. Just like in the first step, we use DOM Inspector
and XPather to discover what the xpaths for the next/previous page links are.
Also, the user should be able to just hit ENTER to go to the result, so let's 
add a target with ENTER as a hotkey for that as well.

[[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/tutorial/productSearch_cnr_01.xml][Here's the CNR file that we got.]]

** Add custom functions to improve the behavior of the page.

Now that we can easily go through the results, is there anything else that we 
can do to improve this page? As a matter of fact, there is! Listening closely 
to what the results sound like, we can hear that the spoken feedback is not 
exactly what we would like to hear. For instance, the first image of the 
result has no alt text and some AT will read the entire URL. That image should 
just be omitted as there is no reason for the user to hear that. Also, the 
star rating is repeated since each star has an alt tag that says how many 
stars there are, and the text of the different parts of the result tend to run 
together. Let's write a short JavaScript function that will process each 
result by adding some smart formatting to it before speaking it. We can then 
use the "action" attribute of the item element in our CNR to call our function 
instead of using the default action of going to the node and speaking it.

While we're at it, we should also add a function that causes the first result 
on a page to be spoken when the page is loaded.

Here's the code for reformatting the results to create a much better auditory 
user interface experience:
: axsProductSearch.speakResult = function(item){
:   var resultRow = item.elem;
:   var title = axsProductSearch.getTitle(resultRow);
:   var desc = axsProductSearch.getDesc(resultRow);
:   var price = axsProductSearch.getPrice(resultRow);
:   var seller = axsProductSearch.getSeller(resultRow);
:   var ratings = axsProductSearch.getRatings(resultRow);
:   var checkout = axsProductSearch.getCheckout(resultRow);
:   
:   var message = title + '. ' + 
:                 price + '. ' +  
:   			  desc  + 				
: 				  seller + '. ' +
: 				  ratings +
: 				  checkout;
:   
:   axsProductSearch.axsLensObj.view(resultRow);
:   resultRow.scrollIntoView(true);
:   axsProductSearch.axsJAXObj.speakTextViaNode(message);
: };

Now, what the user hears for the above screen shot is:

Google e. encyclopedia. $29.99. In partnership with Google, DK presents the 
e.encyclopedia, a revolutionary approach to children's reference publishing. 
An illustrated general encyclopedia ... Buy this at Adoremus Books. 64 seller 
ratings averages out to 5 stars. Accepts Google Checkout.

** Wrapping Things Up 
This AxsJAX script for Product Search is basically done. Of course, 
there are a few things to polish up such as adding controls for search 
refinements. To see how we're evolving this script, please see the 
[[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/productsearch]["productsearch" directory]] 
in the AxsJAX project SVN repository.
