<h3><a name="sec-3">1.2 How Can I Start Using AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Books?</a></h3>


<p>
The simplest way to get started is to use <a href="http://firevox.clcworld.net/">Fire Vox</a> and check the "Site Specific Enhancements" option. By default, this option is checked, so if you did not change it, then you should be ready to go. To start using AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Books, all you need to do is go to <a href="http://books.google.com">Google</a> - the AxsJAX enhancements will automatically be added for you. 
There is nothing Fire Vox specific about AxsJAX - to use a different setup, all you need to do is make sure that you have the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
A modern Web browser like Firefox 2.0 or later that supports
W3C ARIA.
</li>
<li>
An adaptive technology that will respond correctly to the
accessibility enhancements introduced by W3C ARIA.
In particular, many of the enhancements injected by AxsJAX
depend on support for <i>live regions</i> a feature that enables
adaptive technologies like screen readers and self-voicing
browsers deal correctly with asynchronous updates to
portions of a Web page.

</li>
</ol>
If your setup meets these requirements, you can either install
<a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748">GreaseMonkey</a> and install the <a href="http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/googleScriptLoader.user.js">GreaseMonkey script for AxsJAX enhancements</a> or you can install <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/Login?continue=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-axsjax%2Fdownloads%2Flist">the bookmarklet for AxsJAX enhancements.</a> Keep in mind that if you use the bookmarklet
approach, you will have to activate the bookmarklet when you
visit the Google Web Search page in order to use the AxsJAX
enhanced version.


<h3><a name="sec-4">1.3 How Do I Use These Features?</a></h3>


<p>
All of the AxsJAX enhancements are activated through the
keyboard. If your assistive technology uses modes, e.g., <i>browse mode</i> in JFW, please switch to the mode that you use for working
with forms and web applications so that your keystrokes will be
sent to the web page itself. Google Books consists of three distinct types of pages: a search results page, an about this book page, and a viewer page for reading a preview or full view of the book.

When you are on the search results page, the following keys are available:
