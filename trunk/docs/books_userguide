* Introduction To AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Books

** What Is AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Books?


AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Books is the same as regular Google
Books with the following additional features:

  - Quick jump to the /search for books/ box
  - Quick navigation through the search results
  - Automatically go to the next page of results when at the end of the current page
  - Quick navigation to the next/previous search results page
  - Cycle through the different items    on the /About this book/ page
  - Quick jump to the /Search within this book/ field 
  - Keyboard access for reading books a page at a time where full text is available.


** How Can I Start Using AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Books?

The simplest way to get started is to use [[http://firevox.clcworld.net/][Fire Vox]] and check the "Site Specific Enhancements" option. By default, this option is checked, so if you did not change it, then you should be ready to go. To start using AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Books, all you need to do is go to [[http://books.google.com][Google]] - the AxsJAX enhancements will automatically be added for you. 
There is nothing Fire Vox specific about AxsJAX - to use a different setup, all you need to do is make sure that you have the following:

  1. A modern Web browser like Firefox 2.0 or later that supports
     W3C ARIA.
  2. An adaptive technology that will respond correctly to the
     accessibility enhancements introduced by W3C ARIA.
     In particular, many of the enhancements injected by AxsJAX
     depend on support for /live regions/ a feature that enables
     adaptive technologies like screen readers and self-voicing
     browsers deal correctly with asynchronous updates to
     portions of a Web page.

If your setup meets these requirements, you can either install
[[http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748][GreaseMonkey]] and install the [[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/googleScriptLoader.user.js][GreaseMonkey script for AxsJAX
enhancements]] or you can install [[https://www.google.com/accounts/Login?continue=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-axsjax%2Fdownloads%2Flist][the bookmarklet for AxsJAX
enhancements.]] Keep in mind that if you use the bookmarklet
approach, you will have to activate the bookmarklet when you
visit the Google Books page in order to use the AxsJAX
enhanced version.

** How Do I Use These Features?

All of the AxsJAX enhancements are activated through the
keyboard. If your assistive technology uses modes, e.g., /browse
mode/ in JFW, please switch to the mode that you use for working
with forms and web applications so that your keystrokes will be
sent to the web page itself. 


Note that Google books uses three types of views:
