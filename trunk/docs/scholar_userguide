* Introduction To AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Scholar

** What Is AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Scholar?


AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Scholar is the same as regular Google
Scholar with the following additional features:

  - Quick jump to the search box
  - Quick navigation through the search results
  - Automatically go to the next page of results when at the end of the current page
  - Quick navigation to the next/previous page
  - Direct access to "Cited by", "Related articles", "View as HTML", "Library search", "Web search", "BL Direct", and "Import into [a citation format]" links via keyboard shortcuts


** How Can I Start Using AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Scholar?

The simplest way to get started is to use [[http://firevox.clcworld.net/][Fire Vox]] and check the "Site Specific Enhancements" option. By default, this option is checked, so if you did not change it, then you should be ready to go. To start using AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Web Search, all you need to do is go to [[http://www.google.com][Google]] - the AxsJAX enhancements will automatically be added for you. 
There is nothing Fire Vox specific about AxsJAX - to use a different setup, all you need to do is make sure that you have the following:

  1. A modern Web browser like Firefox 2.0 or later that supports
     W3C ARIA.
  2. An adaptive technology that will respond correctly to the
     accessibility enhancements introduced by W3C ARIA.
     In particular, many of the enhancements injected by AxsJAX
     depend on support for /live regions/ a feature that enables
     adaptive technologies like screen readers and self-voicing
     browsers deal correctly with asynchronous updates to
     portions of a Web page.

If your setup meets these requirements, you can either install
[[http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748][GreaseMonkey]] and install the [[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/googleScriptLoader.user.js][GreaseMonkey script for AxsJAX
enhancements]] or you can install [[https://www.google.com/accounts/Login?continue=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-axsjax%2Fdownloads%2Flist][the bookmarklet for AxsJAX
enhancements.]] Keep in mind that if you use the bookmarklet
approach, you will have to activate the bookmarklet when you
visit the Google Web Search page in order to use the AxsJAX
enhanced version.

** How Do I Use These Features?

All of the AxsJAX enhancements are activated through the
keyboard. If your assistive technology uses modes, e.g., /browse
mode/ in JFW, please switch to the mode that you use for working
with forms and web applications so that your keystrokes will be
sent to the web page itself. When you are on the Google Scholar page, the following keys are available:

  - ? (question mark): Brings up a list of the keyboard commands
  - / (slash): Puts focus on the search box
  - Esc: Takes focus away from the search box
  - Enter: Open the current result that has focus.
  - Shift and Enter: Open the current result that has focus in a new window.
  - n or Down Arrow: Puts focus on the next result. If you are on the last result of the page, the next page will be loaded for you automatically.
  - p or Up Arrow: Puts focus on the previous result. If you are on the first result of the page, the previous page will be loaded for you automatically.
  - j or Right Arrow: Puts focus on the next result. If you are on the last result of the page, you will be taken to the first result of the page.
  - k or Left Arrow: Puts focus on the previous result. If you are on the first result of the page, you will be taken to the last result of the page.
  - c: Goes to the "Cited by" link for the current result.
  - r: Goes to the "Related articles" link for the current result.
  - h: Goes to the "View as HTML" link for the current result.
