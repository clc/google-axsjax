<h3 id="sec-3">1.2 How Can I Start Using AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Web Search?</h3>


<p>
The simplest way to get started is to use <a href="http://firevox.clcworld.net/">Fire Vox</a> and check the "Site Specific Enhancements" option. By default, this option is checked, so if you did not change it, then you should be ready to go. To start using AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Web Search, all you need to do is go to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> - the AxsJAX enhancements will automatically be added for you. 
There is nothing Fire Vox specific about AxsJAX - to use a different setup, all you need to do is make sure that you have the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
A modern Web browser like Firefox 2.0 or later that supports
W3C ARIA.
</li>
<li>
An adaptive technology that will respond correctly to the
accessibility enhancements introduced by W3C ARIA.
In particular, many of the enhancements injected by AxsJAX
depend on support for <i>live regions</i> a feature that enables
adaptive technologies like screen readers and self-voicing
browsers deal correctly with asynchronous updates to
portions of a Web page.

</li>
</ol>

<p>If your setup meets these requirements, you can either install
<a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748">GreaseMonkey</a> and install the <a href="http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/googleScriptLoader.user.js">GreaseMonkey script for AxsJAX enhancements</a> or you can install <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/Login?continue=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-axsjax%2Fdownloads%2Flist">the bookmarklet for AxsJAX enhancements.</a> Keep in mind that if you use the bookmarklet
approach, you will have to activate the bookmarklet when you
visit the Google Web Search page in order to use the AxsJAX
enhanced version.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-4">1.3 How Do I Use These Features?</h3>


<p>
All of the AxsJAX enhancements are activated through the
keyboard. If your assistive technology uses modes, e.g., <i>browse mode</i> in JFW, please switch to the mode that you use for working
with forms and web applications so that your keystrokes will be
sent to the web page itself. When you are on the Google Web
Search Page, the following keys are available:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
? (question mark): Brings up a list of the keyboard commands
</li>
<li>
/ (slash): Puts focus on the search box
</li>
<li>
Esc: Takes focus away from the search box
</li>
<li>
Enter: Open the current item that has focus.
</li>
<li>
Shift and Enter: Open the current item that has focus in a new window.
</li>
<li>
n or Down Arrow: Puts focus on the next result. If you are on the last result of the page, the next page will be loaded for you automatically.
</li>
<li>
p or Up Arrow: Puts focus on the previous result. If you are on the first result of the page, the previous page will be loaded for you automatically.
</li>
<li>
j or Right Arrow: Puts focus on the next result. If you are on the last result of the page, you will be taken to the first result of the page.
</li>
<li>
k or Left Arrow: Puts focus on the previous result. If you are on the first result of the page, you will be taken to the last result of the page.
</li>
<li>
1: Puts focus on the One Box. The One Box is a result that
Google believes is especially relevant to your search; for
example, if you typed in "weather in my city, my state"
(where you replaced "my city" and "my state" with your city
and state), Google will have a One Box that gives you your
local weather.
</li>
<li>
r: Puts focus on the first related search term; subsequent
presses will cycle through the list of related search terms.  
</li>
<li>
c: Puts focus on the first alternate category for the same
search; subsequent presses will cycle through the list of
alternate categories.
</li>
<li>
a: Puts focus on the first advertisment; subsequent presses
will cycle through the list of advertisments on the page.
</li>
<li>
g: Guided mode will move the focus through the page so that
it takes the user through all of the interesting parts with
the most interesting parts first. Currently, it takes the
user to the One Box on the first press, followed by the top
four search results, followed by the top sponsored link,
followed by the next three search results and the next
sponsored link and so on until there are no more results, at
which point it will switch to the next three related search
terms and next sponsored link.
</li>
<li>
A (capital A): Switches to the accessible Google Web Search
experiment and automatically repeats your search. Accessible
Search is an early Google Labs product designed to identify
and prioritize search results that are more easily usable by
blind and visually impaired users.
</li>
<li>
W (capital W): Switches to regular Google Web Search and
automatically repeats your search.
