* Introduction To AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Calendar

** What Is AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Calendar?


AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Calendar is the same as Google Calendar with
the following additional features:

  - Keyboard access for navigating events and for retrieving additional information about an event
  - Keyboard access for traversing the list of calendars and selecting/deselecting calendars
  - Spoken feedback via the user's assistive technology for user actions



** How Can I Start Using AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Calendar?

The simplest way to get started is to use [[http://firevox.clcworld.net/][Fire Vox]] and check the
"Site Specific Enhancements" option. By default, this option is
checked, so if you did not change it, then you should be ready to
go. To start using AxsJAX-Enhanced Google Calendar, all you
need to do is go to [[http://calendar.google.com/][Google Calendar ]] - the AxsJAX enhancements will
automatically be added for you. There is nothing Fire Vox
specific about AxsJAX - to use a different setup, all you need to
do is make sure that you have the following:

  1. A modern Web browser like Firefox 2.0 or later that supports
     W3C ARIA.
  2. An adaptive technology that will respond correctly to the
     accessibility enhancements introduced by W3C ARIA.
     In particular, many of the enhancements injected by AxsJAX
     depend on support for /live regions/ a feature that enables
     adaptive technologies like screen readers and self-voicing
     browsers deal correctly with asynchronous updates to
     portions of a Web page.

If your setup meets these requirements, you can either install
[[http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/748][GreaseMonkey]] and install the [[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/googleScriptLoader.user.js][GreaseMonkey script for AxsJAX
enhancements]] or you can install [[https://www.google.com/accounts/Login?continue=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-axsjax%2Fdownloads%2Flist][the bookmarklet for AxsJAX
enhancements.]] Keep in mind that if you use the bookmarklet
approach, you will have to activate the bookmarklet when you
visit the Google Calendar start page  in order to activate the AxsJAX
enhancements.

** How Do I Use These Features?

All of the AxsJAX enhancements are designed to augment the
existing keyboard support present in regular Google Calendar by
generating additional focus events so that the assistive
technology automatically speaks the item having focus. If your
assistive technology uses different modes e.g., /browse-mode/ in
JFW, please switch to the mode that you use for working with
forms and web applications so that your keystrokes will be sent
to the web page itself. When you are on the Google Calendar page,
the following keys are available:

  -  ? (question mark): Lists the keyboard commands
  -  t: Go to today
  -  n or j: Go to the next day
  -  p or k: Go to the previous day
  -  Down arrow: Go to the next event
  -  Up arrow: Go to the previous event
  -  i: Get information about the current event.
  -  q: Go to the Quick Add field for quickly creating events by typing in natural language phrases such as "meeting 3:30 to 4:30 PM tomorrow". [[http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=36604#text][See this page for more details on using Quick Add.]] 
  -  c: Go to the create event form.
  -  f: Go to the field for adding a friend's calendar.
  -  l: Go to the next calendar in the list of calendars.
  -  ; (semi-colon): Go to the previous calendar in the list of calendars.
  -  Space: Select/deselect the current calendar.
