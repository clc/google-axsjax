* Where are the AxsJAX Downloads?

** Introduction

If you're thinking, "AxsJAX sounds great, but where are the downloads?", 
then you are reading the correct file.

AxsJAX is served entirely on the web cloud; aside from a small loader file, 
there is nothing for you to install. All of the enhancements are fetched at 
runtime for you; this means that as sites get AxsJAXed and as existing 
scripts get improved, you get the benefits immediately without dealing with 
the hassle of updates.

** For end users

To use the AxsJAX enhancement scripts, you will need an ARIA-aware browser + 
AT combination.

If you are using [[http://getfirefox.com][Firefox 3]] + a screen reader that 
will work with ARIA, you need to install 
[[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748][Greasemonkey] first. 
After installing Greasemonkey, install 
[[http://google-axsjax.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/googleScriptLoader.user.js][the AxsJAX loader script.]]
Note that if your assistive technology has modes, you will have to be in the 
forms mode of your screen reader (aka, "turn off the PC cursor") for AJAX web 
applications that make heavy use of the keyboard to work properly since you 
need to make sure that your keystrokes are going to the web application and
not being swallowed by your screen reader. As an AJAX powered framework that is
driven by the keyboard, AxsJAX also needs you to be in forms mode to work properly.

If you are using [[http://getfirefox.com][Firefox 3]] + 
[[http://firevox.clcworld.net][Fire Vox]], then you just need to make sure 
you have "Use site specific enhancements" checked. You do not need to install 
anything else as Fire Vox will automatically load AxsJAX scripts for you.

By convention, AxsJAX enhancements use the following keys:

  - ? (question mark) : Speaks the available keys and actions for the current web page  
  - Esc : Leave the currently focused text field. This allows you to send keystrokes so that you can interact with the AxsJAX enhancement on the page instead of typing characters into the text field.  
  - j or down arrow : Go to the next item in the current category  
  - k or up arrow : Go to the previous item in the current category  
  - l or right arrow : Go to the next category of items  
  - h or left arrow : Go to the previous category of items  
  - Enter : Perform the most obvious action for the current item that you are on. For example, if you are currently on a search result, then pressing Enter will follow the link for that result.
  

These keys are only available if there is an AxsJAX enhancement for the site 
that you are on. Also, while we try to stick with these conventions as much as 
possible, there may be times where we deviate slightly. The best way of 
discovering the keys is to hit the "?" (question mark) to hear the available 
keys and actions for the current web page.
